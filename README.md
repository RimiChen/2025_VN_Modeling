# Project Title
Hierarchical Event Segmentation for Visual Narratives: A Case Study on Comics

## Overview
This project is part of a research initiative exploring hierarchical narrative modeling with knowledge graphs. The goal is to provide a proof-of-concept implementation for hierarchical event segmentation and visualization, focusing on comics as a use case.

## Features
- Hierarchical event graph structure for narrative representation.
- Integration of knowledge graphs at event and panel levels.
- Visualization of narrative structure using NetworkX.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Required libraries:
  - NetworkX
  - Matplotlib

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib
```
